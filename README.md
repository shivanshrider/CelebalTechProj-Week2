# ToDo List App

This is my ToDo List project for Week 2 of the CSI - Celebal Summer Internship 2025 at Celebal Technologies.

I made this app to practice React basics like components, state, and props. The app lets you add, complete, and delete tasks. You can also filter and sort your tasks, and everything stays saved even if you refresh the page (thanks to localStorage). I picked a purple theme because I wanted something that looks modern and stands out.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo and open the folder in your code editor.
2. Run `npm install` to install everything you need.
3. Start the app with `npm start`.

## How to Use

- Type a task and click "Add Task" to add it.
- Click the checkbox to mark a task as done.
- Use the trash icon to delete a task.
- Use the dropdowns to filter or sort your tasks.
- Your tasks will stay even if you close or refresh the browser.

## What I Learned

- How to use React hooks like useState and useEffect.
- How to store data in localStorage.
- How to make a responsive UI with CSS.
- How to handle user input and validation.

I had a lot of fun building this and learned a lot about React. Thanks to my mentors for their help and feedback!

## Features

4. **Filter/Sort:**  
   Use the dropdowns to filter (All/Active/Completed) and sort (Date/Name).

5. **Persistence:**  
   Refresh the page or close/reopen the browser. Your tasks should remain (localStorage).

6. **Responsive:**  
   Try resizing the browser or using on mobileâ€”UI should adapt.
